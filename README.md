# Odisseia Project

Odisseia was an attempt of page-based document editor using the (Tiptap)[https://tiptap.dev) library. My initial intent
was to build an editor like Google Docs which supports academic norms like the (ABNT)[https://usp.br/sddarquivos/arquivos/abnt14724_2022.pdf].
However possible, this task soon proved to be way harder than i thought, but still serves as a proof of concept.
